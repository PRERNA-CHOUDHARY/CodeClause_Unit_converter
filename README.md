# CodeClause_Unit_converter


This is a simple length converter application that allows users to convert values between different units of length. Users can input a number in one unit of length, select the unit they want to convert from and the unit they want to convert to, and the application will convert the value and display it in the desired unit of length.

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Features
- Converts values between six units of length: centimeters (cm), meters (m), kilometers (km), inches (in), feet (ft), and miles (mi).
- Displays an error message if the user inputs an invalid number or leaves the input field empty.
- Allows users to convert the input value by clicking a "Convert" button or pressing the "Enter" key.
- Provides a dark mode option to toggle the appearance of the application between light and dark modes.

## How to Use
1. Enter a numerical value in the input field.
2. Select the unit of length you want to convert from using the dropdown menu labeled "From".
3. Select the unit of length you want to convert to using the dropdown menu labeled "To".
4. Click the "Convert" button or press the "Enter" key to see the converted value in the output field.
5. To switch to dark mode, toggle the switch labeled "Dark mode".

## Future Improvements
- Add support for more units of length.
- Allow users to convert between different measurement types (e.g., length, weight, volume).
- Improve the appearance of the application.
